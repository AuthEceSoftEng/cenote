# cenote

[cenote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote) (Katavothra) is a Big Data Management System (BDMS) for event processing and analytics. Our goal was to build an open source equivalent of [keen.io](http://keen.io) analytics and learn about scalable systems in the process. The technology stack is based on:

- Kafka
- Storm
- Cassandra
- MERN stack

and inludes code from programming languages JavaScript, Java and Python.

This is the logistics repository to hold issues, documentation, installation instructions and any code that is across cenote systems.
